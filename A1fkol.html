				<h3>FIVE KINGDOMS OF LIFE</h3>
				<p class="maintext">Abandoned by Earth after the Witherer attack, the colonies of Mars were nearly wiped out. After decades of fighting for survival in ruined colonies and the harsh Martian atmosphere, the remaining colonist factions forged strong bonds and rallied behind their shared hatred of Earth and the Witherers. With the help of their own technology and rare Martian resources, they were able to reverse-engineer Witherer technology, learning much but transforming it to their own ends as they promised not to use the same weapons that destroyed their own people. They vowed to stand as one under the banner of the Five Kingdoms of Life, in the name of the life they had recreated on Mars and their colonies.</p>
				
				<p class="maintext">Over 100 years, the people of the 5 Kingdoms have learned the meaning of sacrifice in their struggle to survive. Now, rebuilt, they carry on this idea with their research, willing to give everything to keep moving forward.</p>
